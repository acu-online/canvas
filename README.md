# Canvas [WIP]

This is an atempt at a API Client for the [Canvas LMS](https://www.canvaslms.com/) 
by [Instructure](https://www.instructure.com/) in Elixir. It's design was inspired 
by and borrows heavily from [DNSimple's API Client](https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-elixir).

There's much more work to be done and things are very likely to change.

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
